  description: software developer since 2011<br>computer engineer since 2016
info:
  aboutme: I got my degree in Computer Engineering in 2016, but I've always been working in the IT field. Up to the age of 20 I had experience as a systems engineer and technician, then I moved towards software development and the analysis of increasingly complex architectures. I currently work as a freelancer.
  network: Human beings feel the need to unite and form a network, the reason is that when you are in a group the challenges of life are easier to overcome. In the field of technology this is even more true, as the challenges become more and more complex day after day. I believe in the value of communication and in the need to form a network of professionals that are also very different from each other. A network that allows you to carry out projects in less time, with more sustainable costs and with greater humanity.
